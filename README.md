Given the following specification, first write at least three tests into the file testsuite.py for the functions the program to fulfill the specification need to contain. Then write the program. Remember to test frequently. The tests help you.

Specification
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 through 100 on the console with three exceptions:

If 3 divides the number write “Fizz” instead of the number
If 5 divides the number write “Buzz” instead of the number
If both 3 and 5 divide the number write “fizzBuzz”



Exercises_DS1
First a couple of definitions:

Definition 1:
Re Wikipedia:

A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of symbols that reads the same backwards as forwards, such as madam or racecar, the date “22/02/2022” and the sentence: “A man, a plan, a canal – Panama”.

Definition 2:
A palindrome is a string whose first and last characters are the same, and the strings between the first and the last characters are a palindrome.

The first definition implies that spaces and punctuation is ignored.

Given the following specification, first write at least three tests into the file testsuite.py for the functions the program to fulfill the specification need to contain. Then write the program. Remember to test frequently. The tests help you.

Specification
Write a function that takes a string as input, and returns “true” if the string is a palindrome, and “false” if it is not.

Write a program that includes the codefile with the function, and tests words or phrases for “palindromy.”

A definition:

Re Wikipedia:

A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number.

Given the following specification, first write at least three tests into the file testsuite.py for the functions the program to fulfill the specification need to contain. Then write the program. Remember to test frequently. The tests help you.

Specification
Write a function that takes a natural number, a positive integer, as input, and returns “true” if the input is prime, and “false” if it is not.

Write a program that includes the codefile with the function, and tests the input for primality.

Test the function with, among others, the integers 9007199254740991, and 9007195909437503.
